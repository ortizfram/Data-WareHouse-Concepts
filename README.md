# Data-WareHouse-Concepts
==============================================
# *️⃣What's Data WareHouse?
`Relational` Data-base designed for `analytical needs`

location where `multiple databases are stored`, & works on the **OLAP** bases (online,anlytical, processing)

# *️⃣What's Data WareHousing?

## ㊗️StagingData through ETL, D.Marts

Act of `organizing & storing` data efficiently in a way that's avaible for peopple to get insights from them `data into info`

this procces of `stagging data` before uploadding to dataWarehouse it's done by `ETL` (extract transform load)

# *️⃣OLAP
❗ __online analytical processing__

flexible way to make complicated `analysis` of `multidimentional data`

- OLTP : data stored in form of 2 dimentional tables 

## ㊗️ advantages:
- new view of looking data

- supports filtering/sorting data

- data can be __refined__
